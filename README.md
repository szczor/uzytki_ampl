# Nurse Rostering

The model itself is in `model/` directore. In the repo there are also several utility scripts:

- `csv2dat.py` that converts input from a number of CSV files into single `.dat` file suitable for model `model/main.mod`.
- `visualization.py` that presents the solution in a human readable way.

The model is linear and it seems to work with `glpsol`.


## Running the model

First to generate data from CSV files you can use `csv2dat.py` script (se following section for more info):

```sh
python csv2dat.py example_data/example.ini test.dat
```

This should generate `test.dat` with input suitable for the model. You can run it with `glpsol` (currently it seems to take 
several minutes for `glpsol` to find a solution; however it then stucks for omptimizing it for at least very long time):

```sh
glpsol -m model/main.mod -d test.dat -o solution.sol --tmlim 1800
```

Or from `ampl` CLI (assuming `model.mod` and `test.dat` are copied to the working directory):

```
option solver cplex;
model model.mod;
data testmini.dat;
solve;
```


## Visualizing the solution

Assuming that you have a `glpsol`â€“generated solution in file `solution.sol` you can generate visualisation like this:

```
python visualization.py solution.sol example_data/example.ini output_name
```

The script generates visualizations of 7-day schedules in a form output_name_week_i.png in a directory `wykresy/`. It produces two types of plots, the ones
where we take into account if nurse works on preferred/unpreferred shifts and the ones where we take into account if nurse works with a preferred/unpreferred
companions. For example if your data contains 28 days and data on preferred/unpreferred shifts and preferred/unpreferred companions, it will generate 4 plots
where each plot represents one week. If your data is shorter than one week, it will generate two plots. If there is no data on for example preferred/unpreferred
shifts, it will produce just one type of plot.

How to read the schedule plots:
- Yellow - nurse has a vacation break
- Green  - nurse works on a preferred shift/ nurse works with a preferred companion
- Red    - nurse works on an unpreferred shift/ nurse works with an unpreferred companion
- Black  - nurse works on a shift that is ambivalent to him/her /nurse works with neither preferred nor unpreferred companions

This script generates also a workhour plot. 
The salmon part shows the number of hours which a nurse has worked throughout the analysed period. The red part shows a nurse's workhour limit.


## Converting input from CSV files

CSV files are converted to `.dat` input for our model by `csv2dat.py` script. Foor convenience the script uses a config file with 
a list of files to process (and several other options). When run, it expects one or two command line parameters:

- The first (required) is path to the config file describing which CAV files to use. For more info, check out example of cuch 
  file: `example_data/example.ini` (every option is commented there). Keep in mind that relative paths to CSV files defined in 
  that file are taken relative to the location of the INI file.
- The second (optional) parameter is the desired path to output file. If present it will override the option `FileName` from 
  `Output` section (otherwise this option must be set in the INI file). The relative path to output is treated as relative to the 
  directory from which the script is invoked.

An example invocation that produces `test.dat` from sample data provided in `example_data/` directory (that were given to us by 
F33) would be:

```sh
python3 csv2dat.py example_data/example.ini test.dat
```
