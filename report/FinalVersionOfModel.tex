\section{A Final Version of the Model}

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

Being a~kind of prototype/POC, the model has several oversimlifications, namely:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It is not allowed to schedule more nurses on any shift than specified by demand.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Intuitive description of the Model (without linearization)}

\subsection{The Final Linear Model}

\subsection{Running on NEOS}

While we developed our model to run on freely available GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) \texttt{glpsol} solver it soon became apparent that without optimized procedures of the commercial solvers the task of solving an mixed integer linear programming optimization task with approx. 20k variables and 50k constraints becomes infeasible. However, thanks to the NEOS Server, "a free internet-based service for solving numerical optimization problems", we were able to apply the Gurobi/AMPL solver to obtain the solution in a reasonable amount of time, that is under one minute. To compare with \texttt{glpsol}, the procedure terminated after one hour of optimization yielded result 10\% worse in terms of reward function value.
